Scala Play 2 with AngularJS prototype for Registered Traveller

Setup
-----

To get you going with this application, just follow along:

In a directory where you wish to clone this project from git:
> $ git clone https://github.com/davidainslie/registered-traveller-prototype.git

Go into the application's new project directory (with the "cd" shown) and complete the following:
> $ cd registered-traveller-prototype

> $ activator

> [registered-traveller-prototype] $ update-classifiers

OR if you want to see the code in Intellij, as well as run it:

> [registered-traveller-prototype] $ idea sbt-classifiers with-sources=yes

> [registered-traveller-prototype] $ test

Hopefully all (unit) "specs" will pass and you can now open up IntelliJ and start going through the specs and code.
